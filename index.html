            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. I <br>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
            <h6> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
              for <br>
               the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
              The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
              the course, I’ve <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</h6>

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <h6>
          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
          professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former 
          student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff 
          did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
          project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my <br>developent 
          experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 
          100% recommend! ”
